It begins very quietly in 1901, with the shoemaking Griggs family of Wollaston, England?”and continues in 1945 in Munich, where a young soldier with a foot injury invented an air-cushioned sole to aid his recovery. His name was Dr. Klaus Maertens, and the iconic Dr. Martens combat boot was designed only after his invention made its way to England. On April 1, 1960 (hence the name ??460??, the 8-eye Dr. Martens 1460 boot arrived on the scene?”and never left.
